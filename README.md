## Home work tracker

A cool app for tween kids, “pre teen” where homework is made less boring by proving them with some fun games after getting their work done.

*As a user I would love a website with an easy navigation btw search and login system. (html, css)

* I would like a website where  I can click my homework as done and submitted then logging into the server, to ensure my daily tasks are up to date before proceeding. (React)

* As a user, I want a webpage where I can play and share my games with other kids while interacting with friends. (Django)

* As a student, I would love to be able to edit my homework in case of an error before finally submitting it. (python)

* As a user, I would like a user experience that enables sharing each other's games while using the game app (API)

* While on the same webpage, I would like to be able to search for online games and books which can be played and read while using the same web app.

* As a tutor, I would like to be able to create homework for my students, delete old work, and update new homework. (CRUD)

* As a tutor, I would love an app with the ability to differentiate between students who are done with their homework and those who are yet to, so they can be reminded on time about their pending homework. (Alert)

* As a parent, I would like to be able to track my child/ward's progress and view their homework. (Database)

 the usuall python manage.py runserver was not running due to some unforseen reasons i just couldn't have it running the usual locall way and working with limited time.

# project contains 2 dashborads :
teacher's dashboard
child dashboard

# when loggedin as admin you can't navigate through teachers dashboard or hub have to logout and login as teacher
because only teacher can create and delete homework


did'nt have enough time to work around the parent dashboard, so at the moment parent cant login or view child's progress
due to the limited time on my hands because i lost 2 weeks working on fixing an old project for regrading.
