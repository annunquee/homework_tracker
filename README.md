# homework_tracker
A cool app for tween kids, where they can have some fun games after getting their homework done.

* I would like a website where on the homepage, I can click my homework as done and submitted before logging into the server, to ensure my daily tasks are up to date before proceeding. (React)

* As a user, I want a webpage where I can play and share games with other kids once we're done with homework. (Django)

* As a student, I would love to be able to edit my homework in case of an error before finally submitting it.

* As a user, I would like a user experience that enables sharing each other's games while using the game app (API)

* While on the same webpage, I would like to be able to search for online games and books which can be played and read while using the same web app.

* As a tutor, I would like to be able to create homework for my students, delete old work, and update new homework. (CRUD)

* As a tutor, I would love an app with the ability to differentiate between students who are done with their homework and those who are yet to, so they can be reminded on time about their pending homework. (Alert)

* As a parent, I would like to be able to track my child/ward's progress and view their homework. (Database)
